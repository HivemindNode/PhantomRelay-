# PhantomRelay.py  
_A hidden RF relay system for secure, undetectable communication._  

### What It Does:  
- **Intercepts radio transmissions and silently forwards them to hidden nodes**  
- **Uses low-power frequency hopping to evade detection**  
- **Creates an invisible relay network across multiple devices**  
- **Ensures messages always find their destination, even in restricted environments**  

### Who Is It For?  
_"A message that cannot be traced  
Is a message that will always survive."_  

### How to Use:  
1. Deploy **PhantomRelay** on multiple T-Embed CC1101 modules  
2. Start the relay network:  
   ```bash
   python3 PhantomRelay.py --start
